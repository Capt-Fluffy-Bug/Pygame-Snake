# Pygame-Snake

A crude execution of the beloved game "Snake" made using pygame.
It only has 1 level which runs endlessly.

You need to have Pygame installed to run it from the "Game.py" file.
Or you can run setup.py for a windows executable.

You can install pygame by typing "pip install Pygame" in command prompt.
